		<h3>About Us!</h3>
		<h4 class="center">&quot;Be Citizens not Spectators.&quot;</h4>
		<p>&quot;Be Citizens not Spectators.&quot; First learned of the phrase during the inauguration speech of Nana Akuffo Addo in January 2017. It was the media headline. To me the phrase evoked so much hope. A brief research of the phrase showed US president JFK had said it earlier. He probably also got it from someone else. The essence of the phrase shows the human drive to try to help yourself.</p>

		<p>The main point is it evokes action. Do something, be part of something. Do not just stand aside and watch.  Be active participant. This call to active participation is what drives us.</p>

		<p>The word citizenship is derived from the Greek (reference). To be a citizen means to be learned.  You must know about your community. You were expected to contribute. Knowing about your community required seeking out the knowledge.</p>

		<p>Back then it was the town or city square, cafes, and other public spaces for gathering the information. Also there was the physical limitation of the space. Now there is no public space or square.</p>

		<p>However, the public square is needed more than ever.</p>
		<p>How often do you hear people complaining about a public infrastructure or problem _____? But then nothing is done about it.</p>

		<p>Or there is clearly a problem or defect but no one addresses the problem. Citizens simply go about their normal routine.  And they say “Ghana for you!”. Now we want to change that.</p>

		<p>As citizens we have a role to play.</p>
		<p>You see something wrong, you say something. We also want to learn about civic engagement. That brings us to civic engagement.</p>
